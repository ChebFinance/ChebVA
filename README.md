ChebVA is an open-source computational finance system for the calculation of 
CVA, DVA, and other counterparty valuation adjustements which fall under the 
umbrella of what is known as XVA. The system uses Chebyshev interpolation and
related methods and algorithms for speeding up the Monte Carlo calculations.
